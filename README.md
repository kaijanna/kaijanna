## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Anna Kaijankoski, and I have 2 years of Graphic design at Noroff. It that cours we were introduced to coding, where I build my first web-page using HTML and CSS.

This was the starting point for continuing my studies, and now I am almost at the end of the first year with Front-End development.

Being a graphic designer at heart, I love that we learn how to implement design ide to actual code, and see how a creative design can be made to an actual website in the end

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently in Front-end develepment at Noroff
